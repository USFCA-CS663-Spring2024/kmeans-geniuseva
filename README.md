# KMeans

Assignment 2 - CS 663 - Machine Learning

In addition to this README.md file, this repository contains two (2) files:
* `Assignment 2 - Clustering.ipynb`: which is a notebook for you to start your implementation of this assignment
* `cluster.py`: which can be the superclass for your implementation of KMeans

I didn't upload the two dataset files to this Github repo since they are too large. Also, I renamed them. The Chicago taxi dataset is named "Taxi_Trips_2013-2023.csv", and the Mopsi Locations dataset is named "Mopsi_Locations_Until_2012_Finland.txt".
